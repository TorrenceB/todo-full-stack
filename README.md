# Getting Started

You'll need to install dependencies for both frontend and backend because each one contains a `package.json` file. Navigate ./frontend and ./backend directories and run

### `npm install`

Once you have installed the dependencies navigate to ./backend and run

### `npm run server`

Now you're ready to run your application! Navigate to ./frontend and run

### `npm run start`
